# Project 2 : GIT LFS Project

This project uses Git LFS (Large File Storage) to handle large binary files efficiently.

## Using Git LFS

This project uses Git LFS (Large File Storage) to handle large binary files efficiently. To work with these files, you'll need to install Git LFS on your machine by following the instructions :

1. Install Git LFS on your machine by following the instructions on the [Git LFS website](https://git-lfs.com/).

Once you have Git LFS installed, you can clone the repository as usual. Git LFS will automatically download the large binary files as part of the cloning process.

To add, commit, and push new binary files to the repository, make sure they are tracked by Git LFS by running the `git lfs track` command with the appropriate file pattern. Then, stage and commit the files as usual using `git add` and `git commit`. When you push your changes to the remote repository, Git LFS will automatically handle uploading the large binary files.
